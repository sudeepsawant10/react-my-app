React js

1. Single Page Application

- doesn't required page reload
- one html page that you visit which then loads all other content using javascript.
- Updates ui without refreshing page
  eg. gmail, facebook, instagram, Trello

2. Mutli Page Application

- works in traditional way
- Whenever a user navigates from one page to another, a request is sent to the server to send a new HTML file for the URL. The server returns a file and then HTML file is loaded in the browser.
  eg. Dribble, Hardvard's website

- Measurely react is designed to developed SPA.

Project Structure:
node_modules:

- containes all the dependencies install by react
  public:
  index.html (for single page)
  faviccon.ico
  manifest.json
- contains details for application
  package-lock.json file:
- contains details of dependencies which are installed
  package.json
- Contains more details of our application (product, development support)

dir src:
index.js

- it mounds our entire application.

app.js (app component):

- contains function inside that we can write code like html

Creat first react app:
create-react-app tool

- The create-react-app toll installs all the liabraries and packages required to build a react application.
- It creats a default configuration for our react project. It also adds some starter files in the newly created application.

What is npm and npx?

1. npm

- It is the node package manager for javascript. It helps you manage all the 3rd party packages and liabraries that you will be installing for your application.
  It is installed automatically when you install NodeJs

2. npx

- It is a node package runner. It is used to download and run a package temporarily.

Commands:
npx create-react-app my-app

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

npm start
Starts the development server and loads the application.

npm run build
Bundles the app into static files for production.

npm test
Starts the test runner.

npm run eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

--------------- Jsx
syntax extenstion to java scripts.

- It allows us to define react elements using syntax that looks very similar to HTML.
  It is used to define the look of the UI. In other words, it is used to define the Structure of React components.

JSX TO JS code conversion: (babel.io)

jsx code:

<div>
	
</div>

js code:
React.createElement("div", null);

<div className="myclass">Hello</div>
React.createElement("div",{
	className:"myclass",
	id:"myId"
}, "hello");

HTML VS Jsx

- Unlike HTML, Jsx couples the rendering logic with other UI logic such as event handling, state changing, data displaying, etc..

eg. In curly braces you can write js.

const imageDesc = "This is a beautiful mountain";

<div>
	<p>{imageDesc}</p>
</div>

--------------------------------- Component ----------------------------
What is component?

- component lets you split the ui into independent, reusable pieces.
- A component is a js class or function that optionally accepts some data and returns a react element that describes how a section of the UI should appear.
  There are 2 types of components:

1. functional components
2. Class-based components

function based eg. BlogCard.js

- we need to convert jsx code to create element which uses react model
  for that import this:
  import React from 'react';

const BlogCard = () => {
return (

<div> Blog Name </div>
)

}

//To import in other file
export default BlogCard;

Importing in App.js

import BlogCard from './BlogCard';

const blogCards = blogArr.map((item,pos)=>{
return (
//Jsx tag (self closing tag)
<BlogCard key={pos}/>
)
})

Modules Exports:
There are two ways we can export a module:

1. Default Export

- It is used when we want to export only one module from a file.

2. Named Export

- It is used when we want to export multiple modules from the same file.

Styling React Elements:

1. Inline
2. External

style attribute for Inline

- In html it expects a string
- but in jsx it expects a object

"Key" property:

- key help React identify which items have changed, or are added or are removed fromt he dynamically generated list items.
  Now two things to remember here:
- A key should uniquely identify a list item among its siblings.
- A key should be given to the outer most elements which is being rendered inside the list.

Stateful vs Stateless Component:

- stateful (means component with some functinality)
  state is alos an object and it can hold any type of value
  State functinality is provided by react component class.
  (inherited by Component)

1. Stateful component:

- These are also known as class-based or contaner or smart components.
- These have a state object.
- These keep a track of changing data via state object.

2. Stateless component:

- These are also knonw as functional-based or presentational or dumb componenet.
- These do not have a state object.
- These print out what is given to them via props or they always render the same thing.

(states of componenet should be minimum as possible to avoid lot of complexity)

Purpose of UseState hook:

- let you use state and other react features without writing a class.
- A hook is a special funtion that lets you hook into react features
- hook is lets you add react state into functional component

When to use?

-

Array distructuring:
Two new variables
employees = first value return by the state
setEmployees = the second
const [employees, setEmployees]
first item is the employee data (state of the employees data is maintain in this item)
second item is a functional reference and it is used wherever we need to change the state of array stored in the first item

- useState returns the pair of values i.e. the current state and the function that updates it

Dipesh malvia reactjs:

- useState, useEffect
- props, state
- components=> lifecycle, methods
- Conditional Rendering
- List & Keys
- Basic Form Handling
- React Project Structure
- Routing React Router

- Set-up JSON Server
- API Calls (Axios)
- React CRUD Operations
- React Search Filter
- React Hooks

Component=Piece of resuable code
You cannot use html in js directly but we can do using react liabrary

return(
//To return more than one div elements use this () paranthesis
//self closing
<Component />
//To pass data
<Component>Content</Component>
)

For class component you have to return inside of render method
class ComponentName extend React.Component{
render() {
return ()
}
}

Redenring List in React:
array of json object
Props= Pass data from partent to child

useState hook :

- for using state in functional component

State is used in class component
eg.
state = {
name: "",
email: "",
}

e.preventDefault()=> For doing operation without refreshing the page load

Function as PROP:

- To pass a data from the parent to child

To update the state using setContacts
rest (takes all the previous states in the contact) and add new contact into it
([...contacts, contact])

useEffect()

- To percist data
- To use localstorage
- when the value changes then rerender the component again.

Package to generate unique id:
npm i uuidv4

Technical Suneja Reactjs Notes:

create app using npm:
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app reactproject

tut4: Folder Structure:
package.json => information about package

index.js => Execution starts running from here

- renders react componenet on html document

tut5: Jsx:

- simple way

/\*

- React lifecycle methods cannot be used in functional component eg. componenetDidMount cannot be used in functional components
- .js or .jsx both are valid for functional component
- no render method used in functional coponents
- functional component can accept and use props
- for ui design or presentation
  eg. funcation App(){
  return ();
  }

class component:

- make use of es6 classes and extend the component class in React
- sometimes called 'start' or 'stateful' components as they tend to implement logic and state
- React lifecycle methods can be used inside class component
- you can pass props down to class components and access them with this.props
  we cannot import class component like this
  import { Header } from './components/Header';

Hooks are js functions, but they impose two additional rules:

1. only call Hooks at the top level.

- Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions

2. Only call Hooks from React function components.

- Don't call Hooks from regular js functions.
  (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks - Your own custom Hoooksl)

PROPS:

- to send the values to components from component calling tag
- we cannot change the value of props in component once it is set
- Don't need to receive props in class component(we use this.props)
- props are immutable

STATE:

- state is managed with in the component
- State can be changed
- UseState Hook -> Functional component
- this.state -> class component

Event Handling - Pranthesis:

- while defining onClick function it should be function not a function call using paranthesis
- if we do so it will call function before the event

- cannot access this in function present in function component

HANDLING THIS AND BIND:

- we cannot use function keyword in class component
- if we use arrow function we don't need to bind this we can use it automatically

END OF EVENT HANDLING - PREVENT DEFAULT BEHAVIOR

- accessing props in state in class component
- when passing props to class component you have to receive it using constructor and call super(props)

FRAGMENT IN REACT

- takes jsx wrap in single element
- why fragment = to avoid unnecessary div tag
- fragment is used to group multiple element without using div
return(
<React.Fragment>
  <h1></h1>
  <div></div>
  <span></span>
  </React.Fragment>
)

LIST IN REACT

- we use map() to iterate item in list it takes call back function
- callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed

MANAGE LIST DATA OBJECT USING STATE & PROPS

- access = onsole.log(this.state.users[0].name)

KEY IN REACTJS

- key to modify, delete, retrive of item
- list must have unique element key props
- one page will have all unique key

STYLING & CSS

- Template literal for applying multiple classes.
- we can apply css using module.css for specific task to apply css it dosen't work on any other component

REACT FORM USING STATE ALONG WITH EVENT HANDLING

- give value = this.state.elment

ROUTING IN REACT

- npm install react-router-dom
- contains BrowserRouter import as Router
- contains Switch, Route, Link
  1221

In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import from

REACT LIFE-CYCLE METHODS

- applies on class component
- call this method whent there is need
  phases=> Mounting, Updating, Unmounting
  html is created in first virtual dom then it will effect on actual dom the whole process is called Mounting
  changes on the html using state props is called Updating
  Deleting the html created in actual dom is called unmounting

Mounting Methods

- getDerivedStateFromProps => Static methods returns something => Get called Before rendering
- componentDidMount => Get called After rendering (called at last)

Updating Methods

- componentDidUpdate => gets called on update of element on dom
- takes prevProps, prevState

HTTP GET REQUEST - Fetch data from REST API
getDerivedStateFromProps

- It is used both in mounting and updating
- It gets called when state is changing because of props

HTTP GET REQUEST - FETCH DATA FROM REST API

- AXIOS LIABRARY=> npm i axios
- jsonplaceholder = (fake rest api)
- To call any webservice, api make use of componentDidMount

MAP FUNCTION array map
POST REQUEST

REACT HOOKS:

- Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering

- hooks are introduce in react 16.8 version
- you need hooks to use any thing from class component into functional component
- hooks are functions that lety you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.
- Hooks allow you to use React without classes. It menns you can use State and other react features without writing a class
- React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState, useEffect etc

useState HOOK:
why introduced?

1. Local variables don’t persist between renders. When React renders this component a second time, it renders it from scratch—it doesn’t consider any changes to the local variables.
2. Changes to local variables won’t trigger renders. React doesn’t realize it needs to render the component again with the new data.

- takes const variable and function

useEffect

- it will call when component is rendered or updated
- takes call back and const variable (optional on which useeffect will work)
- if we don't give any dependency not even empty so it will run every time when page is rendered and when component gets updated
- to avoid this give empty dependency to run it only once or give a dependent state

useState with Previous State

- does state value updates in loop?
- Reataining previous state value

useState with Object

- not merging
- solution use spread operator

useRef

- used in the forms
- we don't have to create function of every component event
- we give const useRef variable to every component

useReducer:

- To overcame the problem of useState
- takes direct functional call instead of setvariable function and intialState variable

REACT CONTEXT API

- To pass the props
- context provide a way to pass the data to the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

here A is provider and B & C are consumer
A->B->C

Higher-Order Components:

- receives existing function as a parameter and returns with extra functionality

Formik and Yup Library:
Formik = To create form (most popular library for react and react native)
Yup = for validation
installation command:
npm i yup
npm i formik

Software engineering

- don't have specialist in industry
- High demand for specialist
- Give a time to upskill yourself and get industry experience
-

React:

- Angluar js not having backward compatibility performance issues
- Overcame the problem of angular
- GraphQl for mobile webapp
- Unidirectional data flow
- Reusable component
- problem=> where to keep css, html, js (choices)
- vue.js = by evan you (Structured ) => not mix of html and js reduced jsx
- lots of supporting liabraries
- react native for mobile apps
- redux simplified version of flux
- functional problem => for lots of data

Roadmap: (Advance react developer)
By creating the things

1. Advance state management:

- useState, useReducer, useContext
- MObx, Redux,
- async operation=> Redux Thunk / Redux saga (middleware)
- selectors, memoize-one, reselect (why need? and How?)

2. Routing and Nevigation

- Nested Routes, Routing Guards, Transition, Animation

3. Authentication and Autherization

- JWT, OAuth implementation

4. Internationalization & Localization

- Multiple language support => I18N next

7. Error handling and login

- Alerts, logs, => Sentry, Bugsnag (message on error to developer)(Feedback from customer/user)

8. Progressive Web Application

- PWA app, caching , offline access, notification

Data Visualization, Error boundaries, Accessibility

Clean code in Reactjs

1. Impure ways to update obj and array (mistake)

- pure functions like concate(), map()

2. React.Fragment not using

- returns inclusive div

3. use keys for rendering arrays (id not always array index)(for better reconsillation)

4. Use functional component
5. Make hooks based component
6. Make small reusable component (Helps in readability)
7. use useReducer when using (more than 3 useStates in same component)
8. follow folder structure
   9 use Array destrucuring
   10 use error boundaries (Handle Exceptions)
   11 Integrate Typescript (for less bugs)

JAVASCRIPT 10 INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:

1. Set Time Out Zero:

- Understanding of Event Loop is important in js with setTimeOut (micro task)
- Talk not only output but also why and how it is coming

2. Placement of js Files:

- Where do keep js file (in body or head)
- aync or difer
- Critical Rendering Path (Which changes are blocking or non blocking after rendering page by brower)
  that'why we have to keep html, css and js seperately.

3. difference between let, const and var:

- Interviews wants to know about do you know block scoping
- Block scoping introduced in es6 (TDZ)

4. Closure

- Explain program, example and output
- Everyday usage (Understand it properly in debugging)

5. Functional Programming

- Pure functions, Map, Filter, Reduce, Compose, Curring (usage, explination)
- Your own polyfill (Higher order function)

6. this keyword

- Call Bind Apply (Implementation)
- arrow functions, window

7. Frameworks

- Which framework will you choose and why, when
- SSR, SSG, SPA
- Vdom, Reconciliation

8. Prototypical Inheritance

- In class implementation (Multilevel)

9. Promises, Aync Await, CallBack

- Difference, Working
- Parallel request, Sub sequential request
- Callback exit, Own Promise Implementation
- State management (coding, and output)

10. Debounce vs Throttle

- type input (Server load)
- User behaviour (Your own version)

Machine Coding Round

- laptop and internet access (and Develop app in 1 to 2 hr) or 8hr
  Two types of question:
  React Profisiancy,Question startup
  Questoin (write in venila js) =>faang

1. Infinite Scroll Implentation using api call

- Ui loader, state mangement, data view, filter, sort
- performance optimisation

2. Calender App

- Metting, Ui interactions (Cell based)

3. Make Excel (senior level)
4. Email App

- drafts, sent, delete, mark important
- Routing, State management

5. Tab implementation
6. Retrive Data from API (Artifacia company)

- Data model of frontend for diff features

7. Drag & Drop API of js

CSS:

1. Carousel (Aspect Ratio)
2. ...

------------------- MERN STACK DEVELOPMENT:
MongoDB => Database
Express => Server
React => Frontend (state, context, reduce, routers)
Node => Runtime
