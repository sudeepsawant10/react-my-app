/*
- React lifecycle methods cannot be used in functional component eg. componenetDidMount cannot be used in functional components
- .js or .jsx both are valid for functional component
- no render method used in functional coponents
- functional component can accept and use props
- for ui design or presentation
eg. funcation App(){
  return ();
}

class component:
- make use of es6 classes and extend the component class in React
- sometimes called 'start' or 'stateful' components as they tend to implement logic and state
- React lifecycle methods can be used inside class component 
- you can pass props down to class components and access them with this.props
we cannot import class component like this
import { Header } from './components/Header';

Hooks are js functions, but they impose two additional rules:
1. only call Hooks at the top level.
- Don't call Hooks inside loops, conditions or nested functions

2. Only call Hooks from React function components.
  - Don't call Hooks from regular js functions.
  (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks - Your own custom Hoooksl)

PROPS:
- to send the values to components from component calling tag
- we cannot change the value of props in component once it is set
- Don't need to receive props in class component(we use this.props)
- props are immutable

STATE:
- state is managed with in the component
- State can be changed
- UseState Hook -> Functional component
- this.state -> class component

Event Handling - Pranthesis:
- while defining onClick function it should be function not a function call using paranthesis
- if we do so it will call function before the event

- cannot access this in function present in function component

HANDLING THIS AND BIND:
- we cannot use function keyword in class component
- if we use arrow function we don't need to bind this we can use it automatically

END OF EVENT HANDLING - PREVENT DEFAULT BEHAVIOR
- accessing props in state in class component
- when passing props to class component you have to receive it using constructor and call super(props)

FRAGMENT IN REACT
- takes jsx wrap in single element
- why fragment = to avoid unnecessary div tag
- fragment is used to group multiple element without using div
return(
  <React.Fragment>
  <h1></h1>
  <div></div>
  <span></span>
  </React.Fragment>
)

LIST IN REACT
- we use map() to iterate item in list it takes call back function
- callbacks are a great way to handle something after something else has been completed

MANAGE LIST DATA OBJECT USING STATE & PROPS
- access = onsole.log(this.state.users[0].name)

KEY IN REACTJS
- key to modify, delete, retrive of item
- list must have unique element key props
- one page will have all unique key 

STYLING & CSS 
- Template literal for applying multiple classes.
- we can apply css using module.css for specific task to apply css it dosen't work on any other component

REACT FORM USING STATE ALONG WITH EVENT HANDLING
- give value = this.state.elment

ROUTING IN REACT
- npm install react-router-dom
- contains BrowserRouter import as Router
- contains Switch, Route, Link
1221

In react-router-dom v6, "Switch" is replaced by routes "Routes". You need to update the import from
